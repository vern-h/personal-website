## How I Used AI

This project was designed with a clear visual and structural goal in mind before writing any code. I utilized generative AI tools to assist in accelerating the development process — by crafting precise prompts based on my understanding of HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, CSS Grid, and responsive design principles.

The AI-generated code served as a foundation, which I then refined, refactored, and customized to match my design system, ensure responsiveness, and enhance accessibility. This workflow demonstrates my ability to **integrate AI effectively**, not as a shortcut, but as a **creative and strategic partner** in the frontend development process.
